This is a school project did in *2020-2021* as an attempt to integrate the knowledge of Conic Sections(Mathematics Subject) with the Visual Representation Library-`Matlotlib` of the Python Programming language.

This program is a Menu-Driven Program that can plot Conic Sections and provide further information on the graph so formed according to the questions stored in the MySQL Database. Simply run the Python Script, the further instructions will then be displayed in the terminal. Any output will be displayed in a `Matplotlib` window.

### MySQL Tables:

Just including the screenshot of the `MySQL` of the tables required in the Project. 
These Tables contain the questions that get displayed when the program has displayed the graph of requested Conic Section.

**NOTE:** These tables are present in the datbase named as *Conic* made on MySQL.
